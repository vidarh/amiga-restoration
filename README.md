Amiga Restoration
=================

This repository contains a collection of programs selected from classic Amiga collections
that I am in the process of "restoring" so that they will build on current versions of AmigaOS
and AROS.

Currently I am starting primarily with apps from the Fish disks, because they contain a large
selection of "classic" Amiga freeware that deserved to be restored.

Why do you do this?
-------------------

Because I can... And because many of these programs are important parts of the Amiga legacy,
and though they will run under UAE, I like the thought of cleaning them up, making them
portable and "OS legal".

I also enjoy playing around with AROS and modern versions of AmigaOS, and restoring this code
is a good learning exercise in terms of handling architecture portability (AROS on x86 vs.
AmigaOS on 68k and PPC - little endian vs. big endian), as well as learning the quirks of
"new" AmigaOS.

State of the software
---------------------

Note that many of the programs I'm adding initially **are** likely to crash your machine.

Many of them were buggy, and I probably have introduced new ones too...
